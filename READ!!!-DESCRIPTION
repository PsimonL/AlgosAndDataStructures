Most of implementations I poses doesn't fit to be posted, very messy stuff, and rest of them are not fully mine,
they are the effect of brainstorm with other co-studens and our professor which conducted the laboratory classes.

So I've linked pretty good materials, which I could because most of my university materials are not available for public,
but you could find pretty good stuff at: https://epodreczniki.open.agh.edu.pl/handbook/list

Classes were at 2nd year so long time ago, but with more free time I'll implement myself.
